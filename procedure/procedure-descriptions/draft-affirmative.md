# Draft affirmative 

Instruments subject to the draft affirmative procedure are laid in draft and require the approval of Parliament signed into law.

Draft affirmatives are usually laid before both Houses of Parliament and require a motion to approve to be agreed to in both Houses before they can be made and come into force. Instruments related to taxation are laid in the House of Commons only and require only the approval of the House of Commons. 

Before approval is decided upon, there must be a debate in each House. In the House of Commons, this is in a Delegated Legislation Committee or, less commonly, in the Chamber. In the House of Lords, this is in either Grand Committee or the Chamber.
