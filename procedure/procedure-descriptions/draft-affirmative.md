# Draft affirmative 

Instruments subject to the draft affirmative procedure are laid in draft and require approval in Parliament before being signed into law. Instruments concerning taxation are not laid in the House of Lords and only need the approval of the House of Commons. The House of Commons debates the instrument in a Delegated Legislation Committee or in the Commons Chamber, and decides whether to approve in the Commons Chamber. The House of Lords debates the instrument in Grand Committee or in the Lords Chamber, and decides whether to approve in the Lords Chamber.
