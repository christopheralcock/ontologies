# Draft affirmative 

Some statutory instruments are subject to the affirmative procedure. This means Parliament has to actively approve the statutory instrument before a minister can sign it into law. The last time the House of Commons did not approve an affirmative statutory instrument was in 1978.

Instruments subject to the draft affirmative procedure are laid in draft and need to be approved before it can be made by the Minister and signed into law.

Draft affirmatives are usually laid before both Houses of Parliament and require a motion to approve to be agreed to in both Houses before they can be made and come into force. Instruments related to taxation are laid in the House of Commons only and require only the approval of the House of Commons.

Before approval is decided upon, there must be a debate in each House. In the House of Commons, this is in a Delegated Legislation Committee or, less commonly, in the Chamber. In the House of Lords, this is in either Grand Committee or the Chamber.
