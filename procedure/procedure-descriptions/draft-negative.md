# Draft negative 

Instruments subject to the draft negative procedure do not require the approval of Parliament for it to become law. Either the House of Commons or the House of Lords can pass a motion within the objection period calling for the instrument to not be made, which stops it being signed into law.  

In the draft negative procedure, the instrument cannot be made (signed into law) by the Minister until the objection period has concluded.
