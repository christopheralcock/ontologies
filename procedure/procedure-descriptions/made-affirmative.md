# Made affirmative 

Instruments subject to the made affirmative procedure are made on being laid, then come into force.  

The making of the instrument starts the approval period.

If either House does not approve the instrument within the approval period, the instrument is stopped.

Instruments concerning taxation do not require approval in the House of Lords.

The approval period is defined within the parent Act and is commonly 28 or 40 days.
