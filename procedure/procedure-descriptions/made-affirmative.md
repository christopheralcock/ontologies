# Made affirmative 

Instruments subject to the made affirmative procedure are laid after being made and coming into force.  

The making of the instrument starts the approval period. If the House of Commons and the House of Lords (or, if related to taxation, only the House of Commons) do not approve the instrument within the approval period, the instrument is stopped. The approval period is defined within the parent Act, but is usually 28 or 40 days.
