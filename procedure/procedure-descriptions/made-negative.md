# Made negative 

Instruments subject to the made negative procedure do not require the approval of Parliament for it to become law. Either the House of Commons or the House of Lords can pass a motion within the objection period to annul the statutory instrument, which stops it having legal effect. 

In the made negative procedure, instruments can come into force at any time.
