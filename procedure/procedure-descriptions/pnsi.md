# Proposed negative 

Instruments subject to the proposed negative procedure are laid when the Minister uses delegated powers under the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and proposes to use the negative procedure.  

Once laid, a committee in each House – the European Statutory Instruments Committee in the Commons, and the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee in the Lords – have 10 sitting days to consider the instrument and recommend whether the SI should undergo the made negative or draft affirmative procedure. 

The recommendation is not binding and the Minister is free to disagree with one or both committees and lay a statutory instrument under either procedure, but first must make a written statement explaining why they have chosen to disagree with the recommendation.
