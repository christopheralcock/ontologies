# Proposed negative 

Instruments subject to the proposed negative procedure are laid by a Minister who, exercising powers under the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018, proposes to use the made negative procedure. Each House has 10 sitting days after laying to consider the instrument and agree with the proposal to use the made negative or recommend the use of the draft affirmative procedure. In the House of Commons, the instrument is considered by the European Statutory Instruments Committee. In the House of Lords, the instrument is considered by the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee. A result of consideration does not bind a Minister, who may lay a statutory instrument under either procedure, but must make a written statement if disagreeing with a committee's recommendation.
