# Proposed negative 

Instruments subject to the proposed negative procedure are laid by a Minister exercising powers under the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018.  

After being laid, each House has 10 sitting days to consider the instrument and recommend the use of either the made negative or draft affirmative procedure. 

In the House of Commons, the instrument is considered by the European Statutory Instruments Committee.

In the House of Lords, the instrument is considered by the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee.

A recommendation does not bind a Minister, who may disagree with either committee and lay a statutory instrument under either procedure after making a written statement explaining their disagreement.
